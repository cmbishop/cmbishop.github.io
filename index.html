    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>Hi, I'm Matt Bishop. This is my page where I share all of my favorite work, from web development to video
      art production. Check out my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> to view examples of my work! I am always
      expanding my portfolio and adding new things to this page - you can also check out my
      <a href="https://github.com/cmbishop">Github</a> page to see lots of exercises and examples I've worked on.</p>

    <p>I have recently finished <a href="https://pdxcodeguild.com/">PDX Code Guild</a>, a programming and web
      development boot camp in Portland, OR. I'm also a student at Portland State University and am nearing completion
      of a Bachelor's degree in Film. I've gone through loads of online courses and programs to round out my programming
      knowledge as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Please feel free to poke around and check out my projects or my GitHub page. I am a very well-rounded web
    developer that has lots to offer to the right place!</p>

<h4>Skills I've learned or am currently focusing on:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
      <li>Django</li>
      <li>Node, Express, Mongo</li>
    </ul>
  <h4>Soft skills I have developed through education / work:</h4>
  <p>I have learned many invaluable skills over the course of my college and professional career. With over a decade and a half of experience in the service industry, I have honed numerous interpersonal skills rather adeptly. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Communication - I am a proficient communicator. Whether I am managing staff or working within a group on a project or goal, I am able to assess need, express myself and listen to others. </li>
  <li>Teamwork - I have never worked in an environment where I wasn't part of a team. It is only through teamwork that expectations are established and goals met. I thrive in this environment!</li>
  <li>Adaptability - I am accustomed to high-stress situations that require deadlines to be met or time-sensitive actions to occur. But I also appreciate the value of planning and organizing and will afford as much time as needed to get the job done right.</li>
  <li>Problem Solving - As a programmer I am expected to, ultimately, solve problems and find solutions with code. I am also well-versed in conflict resolution, maintaining good working relationships and offering solutions to problems people face in a work environment.</li>
  <li>Leadership - Through careful observation, empathy, warmth and open-mindedness, I often inspire others to do their best in a team-oriented environment!</li>
</ul>
  <p>I am more than happy to forward a resume if you are interested in learning more!</p>
